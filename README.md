### Description

dirsyncr keeps two directories upto date so the contents are identical (within
the resolution of the update interval).

### Why should I use it instead of rsync?

The main reason of course is that it's written in go and open source so you can 
modify it to suit your needs.  While rsync is very powerful, the list of options is
several pages long and intimidating to new users.    

### How does it work?

### <font color=red> >>> Please Read This First <<< </font>

### Background Info on the problem

### Installation

If you have a working go installation on a Unix-like OS:

> ```go get github.com/hotei/dirsyncr```

If you don't have go installed you can always download the git repository as
a zipfile and extract it or just browse the godoc.org if you are just curious.
